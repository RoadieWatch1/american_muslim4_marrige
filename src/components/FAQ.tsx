  {
    question: 'How does the wali feature work?',
    answer: 'Women can invite a wali (guardian) during signup. The wali receives intro requests for approval and can join chaperoned chats to ensure Islamic guidelines are followed.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is AM4M really free?',
    answer: 'Yes! Our free plan lets you browse, like profiles, and send 1 Super-Intro per day. Premium plans unlock unlimited likes, advanced filters, and priority features.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How are profiles verified?',
    answer: 'We verify identity through ID upload and selfie matching. Photos and videos are moderated to ensure they meet Islamic modesty guidelines.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I match with someone whose wali is involved?',
    answer: 'If a woman has wali involvement enabled, your like becomes an "intro request" that her wali must approve before you can chat.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I report inappropriate behavior?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. We have robust reporting and blocking features. Our moderation team reviews all reports within 24 hours.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What makes AM4M different from other apps?',
    answer: 'We prioritize Islamic values: marriage intentions only, modest media rules, optional wali involvement, and chaperoned messaging. No casual dating.'
